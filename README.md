# DOOM_VSD_Tapeout_Week1

## Program Overview
This repository documents my **Week-1** progress through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** - a groundbreaking 10-week collaboration with **3,500+ participants** across India, organized by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.

This program represents India's most ambitious semiconductor initiative, taking participants from RTL design to actual silicon fabrication using industry-standard Synopsys tools and SCL180 PDK.

## üéØ Program Objectives
- **End-to-end RISC-V SoC Design**: From concept to GDSII
- **Industry-grade Experience**: Using Synopsys EDA tools and foundry PDKs
- **National Semiconductor Mission**: Contributing to India's silicon self-reliance
- **Hands-on Fabrication**: Actual tapeout with real silicon validation



## üìä Daily Progress Tracking

Each day's work is documented with:
- **Objectives** - What was planned
- **Achievements** - What was completed
- **Challenges** - Issues encountered and solutions
- **Learnings** - Key technical insights
- **Next Steps** - Plan for following day

### **Learning Outcomes**
- **End-to-end chip design** experience
- **Industry-standard methodology** knowledge
- **Real tapeout** participation
- **Collaboration** in large-scale projects

## üìä Weekly Tasks List 
- [Day 2 - Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles](DAY%202/Day_2_Progress.md)



## ü§ù Collaboration & Community

This program brings together:
- **3,500+ participants** from across India
- **Academic institutions** and **industry experts**
- **National foundries** and **design houses**
- **Government initiatives** supporting semiconductor mission
